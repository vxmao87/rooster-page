        A rooster is a type of bird that is similar to a cockerel or a cock, and is usually a male chicken. It is a very fast animal that can crow so loud that they push their predators away just by their sheer sound!

        Roosters are similar to chickens in that both of them run very, very fast! But only one pof them can crow so loud so as to ward off predators and wake up everyone in them morning!
